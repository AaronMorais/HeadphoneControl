Headphone Control
========================

Overview
--------
This is an OS X application that modifies the behaviour of the Apple headphone media control button. 
Currently, it mimics the behaviour of the play/pause/next/previous media keys based on how you press the headphone media control button.
One day it will disable the opening of itunes automatically by applying play-button-itunes-patch by thebitguru. This patch should be applied to use this application as intended.
